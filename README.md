Thermal Comfort provides a variety of thermal indices and thermal perceptions including feels like temperatures in numeric and textual representation for Home Assistant.

## Sensors:

**Full list
 [2.1](https://github.com/dolezsa/thermal_comfort/blob/2.1/documentation/sensors.md) /
 [1.5](https://github.com/dolezsa/thermal_comfort/blob/1.5/documentation/sensors.md) /
 [master](https://github.com/dolezsa/thermal_comfort/blob/master/documentation/sensors.md)**

### Numeric Indices

Thermal Comfort provides numerical indices like `dew point`, `frost point`, `absolute humidity` and `moist air enthalpy` that are numeric values usable for further automations but also human readable. e.g. dew point tells the temperature to which air must be cooled to produce dew on a surface.

### Bio Indices / Perception

Thermal Comfort also provides a variety of bio indices like `humidex` or `heat index` giving numeric values of human perceived temperatures (feels like temperature). In addition we also provide textual perception sensors that describe the range of an index in human readable form e.g. comfortable or uncomfortable.

cd thermal_comfort
# if you want a specific version checkout its tag
# e.g. git checkout 1.0.0

# replace $hacs_config_folder with your home assistant config folder path
cp -r custom_components $hacs_config_folder
```

* Download the source release and extract the custom_components folder into your home assistant config folder.

Finally you need to restart home assistant before you can use it.

### Custom Icons
[Install](https://github.com/rautesamtr/thermal_comfort_icons#install) Thermal Comforts icon pack.
