# Sensors:

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Absolute Humidity</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    Absolute humidity is a measure of the actual amount of water vapor
      (moisture) in the air.
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Heat Index</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    The heat index combines air temperature and relative humidity to posit a
    human-perceived equivalent temperature.
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Humidex + Perception</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    The humidex (humidity index) describes how hot the weather feels to an average person as a result of the combined effect of heat and humidity. It is calculated from the dew point.
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Dew Point</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    The dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become
    saturated with water vapor and dew forms on surfaces.
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Thermal Perception</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    Human perception of the dew point.
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Frost Point</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    Frost point, temperature, below 0° C (32° F), at which moisture in the air 
    will condense as a layer of frost on any exposed surface.
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Frost Risk</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    Risk of Frost based on current temperature, frost point and absolute humidity.
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Relative Strain Index/Perception</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    A measure of discomfort resulting from the combined effect of temperature and humidity. It assumes a person dressed in a light business suit, walking at a moderate pace in a very light air motion. It is applicable to assess heat stress of manual workers under shelter at various metabolic rates. Valid for temperatures between 26 and 35°C (79 to 95°F).
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Summer Simmer Index</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    Provides a proven indicator of heat stress concerns and discomfort using meaningful equivalent temperature values for general public acceptance and awareness.
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Summer Simmer Zone</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    Human perception of the summer simmer index.
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Moist Air Enthalpy</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    The enthalpy of moist air is the sum of the enthalpy of the dry air and the enthalpy of the water vapour. Enthalpy is the total energy of a thermodynamic system.
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Summer Scharlau Index/Perception</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    The summer Scharlau index describes a bioclimatic thermal comfort when temperature values are higher than 0°C. Valid for temperatures 17° to 39°C (63° to 102°F) and humidity >= 30%.
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Winter Scharlau Index/Perception</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    Reflects the level of human discomfort caused by cooling. Valid for: temperatures -5 to +6°C (23 to 43°F) and humidity >= 40%.
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Thoms discomfort Index/Perception</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    Indicates the level of discomfort as a result of high temperature and the combined effect with relative humidity.
  </dd>
